SNP data here is from Ed McAssey's dryad.

I downloaded the data from the dryad. The data were in the GenAlEx format.
There were 245 dupliate site names in the dryard download and they were removed.
The GenAlEx file header was edited to reflect the removal of duplicate sites
GenAlEx uploaded to R as a genind object
converted from genind to genlight
converted from genlight to plink.csv and exported.

I'm not sure if the plink file is a real plink file. No map file was output by ddartR.
